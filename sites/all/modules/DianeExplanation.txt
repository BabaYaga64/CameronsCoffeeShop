1. Enable module, creates a menu item.

'type' => MENU_NORMAL_ITEM,

2. Click on the menu item, it takes you to a URL

$items['title_case'] = array(
$items[‘URL’] = array(

3. So we’re at the url /title_case what do we display?

whatever is produced by the function named in page callback.

'page callback' => 'drupal_get_form'
‘page callback’ => ‘say_hello’
‘page callback’ => ‘title_case_success’


 $items['hello_friend']   —— URL
'page callback' => 'say_hello',  —— function to run at the URL
function say_hello() { —— the function itself.

3. drupal_get_form gets called. And it says what form should I get?

We tell it to get the title_case_form by putting that name in page arguments.

'page arguments' => array('title_case_form'),

4. So then in our function title_case_form we tell drupal what fields we want in the form. That’s the giant array.

Then the form is displayed, the user enters stuff and hits the submit button, and then we can grab the information from the form, using hook_form_submit.

function title_case_form_submit($form, &$form_state) {      $title = $form_state['values']['convert_case']; 	  $thing_we_need = $form_state['values’][‘name_of_field’];

	$people[‘thor’][‘phonenumber’]
  $people[‘thor’][‘address’][‘zipcode’]

all of a user’s crap that they entered into the form lives in $form_state[‘values’].
 }
